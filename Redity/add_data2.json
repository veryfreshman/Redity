"body":"You were in purple yoga pants. I was looking at protein bars when you walked up to do the same. It was about 11:30 pm on Sunday night. I should have said something to you, as you are gorgeous, but I was caught off guard. I was not expecting someone so hot to be in Safeway at that time I guess. I was in a Giants hat. Anyway, on the off chance you see this, and had any interest in me, feel free to reply!",
